List of fixes to YAML event logs generated by tpm2-tools:

* MokList fix: the EV_IPL event is handled incorrectly when
  translating its event string. The entire string is translated
  instead of stopping at the ending zero. Thus the translation YAML
  ends up with garbage characters.

* Partition data fix: the partition name in the last GPT partition for
  GPT_EVENT often comes out as (null) when processed by tpm2_eventlog
  because the BIOS generating the event log does not properly clear
  all 72 bytes of the partition name, and some of the garbage
  following the trailing zero in the string is not utf-16
  decodeable. Thus the fixed 36-character zero terminated string
  translation fails (tpm2_eventlog_yaml.c, line 187)
